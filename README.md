# pysubbreaker
Break any substitution/caesar cipher in a matter of seconds (source code based off of the people at practicalcryptography.com)

## How to use

1) In your terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2) Place your ciphertext into `input.txt`
3) Run `sub_cipher_breaker.py` and wait a few seconds to find the key and plaintext

## Notes

This has only been tested on Python 3.12 but should work on 3.7+
